# Janky Firebase Demo

The impromptu firebase demo where I done messed up. 

## How To Run

First clone the repo. You can do this by running the following: `git clone https://github.com/lawrencewin/firebase-convergent-demo.git` in a terminal window

Once that's done, in your window, run `cd firebase-convergent-demo` and run `npm start` or `yarn start`. This should start the application in a browser window. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Setting up Firebase

In Firebase.js in the src folder, I configure my app. Pushing to this repo, I removed my app configuration. For you guys, paste in yours, create a collection called "posts" ( or replace the collection name ). For the demo to work, one document has to have the properties "title", "content", and "user".
